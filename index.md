Welcome to the Phune Gaming game development documentation. Here you will find everything you need to know to develop games for the Phune Gaming platform.

<h3>What is Phune Gaming?</h3>

Phune Gaming is a social multiplayer HTML5 gaming platform which allows casual games to be played online against real users. The Phune Gaming platform is composed of three main components:

* A highly scalable and performant application server
* The Phune Gaming client platform
* And the games

<h3>Why should I develop games for Phune Gaming?</h3>

Phune Gaming supports multiple platforms including desktop, mobile and TV. Developing a game for Phune Gaming will allow you to reach a vast number of gamers who will be able to play your game no matter where they are or what device they use.

<h3>What knowledge do I need?</h3>

To develop a game for Phune Gaming you will need to build two essential components: the game itself and server-side rules. For the game you can use your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills and, if you prefer, you are free to use your favorite JavaScript game engine. The server-side rules are needed to manage the game states and validate the players' moves. The server-side rules can be written in JavaScript, Java or Drools.

<h3>How to submit a game?</h3>

In order to add a new game to Phune Gaming, we require that a developer send us the following components:

* The game distribution/binary
* The server-side rules used for server validations

To implement and test these components on your development machine, please follow the guides below:

            <p>Install Phune Gaming</p>
        </a>
    </li>
    <li class="text-center">

            <img src="/img/sdk-js.png" alt="Phune Gaming SDK for JavaScript" />
            <p>JavaScript SDK</p>
        </a>
    </li>
    <li class="text-center">
        <a href="/server-rules.html">
            <img src="/img/server-rules.png" alt="Phune Gaming Server-Side Rules" />
            <p>Server-Side Rules</p>
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

Alongside the documentation, feel free to have a look at the [Tic-Tac-Toe source code](https://github.com/phune-gaming/pg-tic-tac-toe) for a complete game implementation example.

Once the game is ready, send us an email to [pg-dev@present-technologies.com](mailto:pg-dev@present-technologies.com) with the two required components for a review and we will give you our feedback.

Good luck! <br />
