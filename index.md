description: Learn how to create an HTML5 game and publish it with the Phune Gaming platform

Phune Gaming platform is composed by three main components:

* A highly scalable and performant application server
* The client platform
* And the games

In order to add a new game to Phune Gaming, we require that a developer send us the following components:

* The game distribution/binary
* The game rules used for server validations

To implement and test these components in your machine, please follow the steps below:

<ul class="small-block-grid-3">
    <li class="text-center">
        <a href="/install.html">
            <img src="/img/install.png" alt="Install Phune Gaming" />
            <p>Install Phune Gaming</p>
        </a>
    </li>
    <li class="text-center">
        <a href="/sdk-js.html">
            <img src="/img/sdk-js.png" alt="Phune Gaming SDK for JavaScript" />
            <p>JavaScript SDK</p>
        </a>
    </li>
    <li class="text-center">
        <a href="/server-rules.html">
            <img src="/img/server-rules.png" alt="Phune Gaming Server Rules" />
            <p>Server Rules</p>
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

Alongside this documentation, feel free to look at the [Tic-Tac-Toe source code](https://github.com/phune-gaming/pg-tic-tac-toe) for a complete game implementation example.

Once the game is ready and ready to be reviewed by us, send an email to [pg-dev@present-technologies.com](mailto:pg-dev@present-technologies.com) with the two required components.
